# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's
01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > The difference is that synchronous code runs one line after another, while asynchronous can "await" for certain events to happen before running it's code

02. What is an event listener?

  > An event listener is something that watches a specific value and does something when it changes

03. What does *REST* stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean??

  > Representational state transfer, it basically means that it follows the HTTP Protocol and uses HTTP requests like POST, PUT, GET & DELETE

04. What is a callback / higher order function?

  > It is a function that occurs after a different function has finished running

05. What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?

  > an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. We capture an error from a promise by using Try Catch and putting a Pop.error(error) in the catch

06. Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?

  > Post, Put, and Get

07. What does the `API` acronym stand for?

  > Application programming interface

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?

  > Make the function asynchronous 

09. What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?

  > It is a way to restrict direct access to certain values you may not want the user to be able to look at / utilize

10. What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?

  > 200

11. What is a 400 error?

  > It is a bad request error code.
